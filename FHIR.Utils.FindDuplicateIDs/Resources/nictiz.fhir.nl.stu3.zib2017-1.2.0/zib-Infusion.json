A feeding tube can be inserted through the nose, in the stomach or in the intestines (duodenum, jejunum). \r\n\r\nPercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a technique in which a feeding tube is placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. This thin tube (PEG tube) is used to feed a patient who is incapable of oral food intake for a prolonged period of time.","purpose":"The purpose of an infusion is usually to administer fluid and/or medication. \r\nInformation on present infusions is recorded to inform other health professionals. This information is of importance in determining the care required for the patient and in safely administering medication. In a transfer situation, the information offers the option to realize continuity of care by organizing specific expertise and materials in advance, for example.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-infusion-v3.2-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Infusion-v3.2(2017EN)","name":"HCIM Infusion-v3.2(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"DeviceUseStatement","baseDefinition":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-MedicalDevice","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"DeviceUseStatement","path":"DeviceUseStatement","short":"FeedingTubeSystem","definition":"FeedingTube describes the presence of a feeding tube.

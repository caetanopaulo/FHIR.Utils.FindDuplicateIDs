Currently, the term is used more broadly for all forms of cohabitation which form a recognizable social unit, of people who are or who are not related and who have long-lasting, affective bonds and provide each other with support and care.","purpose":"Information on the patient’s family situation is important in determining the extent to which the patient receives and can receive care and support. For example, the age of the patient’s children partially determines whether they can play a role in caregiving.     It is also important to know whether the patient needs support for daycare and/or care for dependent family members.     Situations in which this information is important include for example being discharged from the hospital or nursing home.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-familysituation-v3.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/FamilySituation-v3.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM FamilySituation-v3.0(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation","path":"Observation","short":"FamilySituation","definition":"Root concept of the FamilySituation information model.

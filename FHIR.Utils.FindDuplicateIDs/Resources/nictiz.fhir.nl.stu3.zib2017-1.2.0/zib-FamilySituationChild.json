Children can have multiple family situations when they live partly with their father and partly with their mother e.g. after a divorce.         Currently, the term is used more broadly for all forms of cohabitation which form a recognizable social unit, of people who are or who are not related and who have long-lasting, affective bonds and provide each other with support and care.","purpose":"Information on the child’s family situation is important in determining the extent to which the child and its family need care and support.

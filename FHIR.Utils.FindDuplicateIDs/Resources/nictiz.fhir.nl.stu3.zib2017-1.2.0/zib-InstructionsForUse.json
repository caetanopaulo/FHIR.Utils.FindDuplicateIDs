This can mean: 1 tablet fixed per day and 1 tablet as needed or, as needed, a maximum of 2 tablets.As needed medication is not included in GDS. In the first situation, 1 tablet comes in the GDS (drug dispensing systems) and 1 tablet is delivered separately. In the second situation there is only separate delivery.The system must make sufficiently clear whether the entire instruction or part of the dose is necessary.

The extension can be seen as an indicator stating whether the patient is deemed capable of overseeing the consequences of a certain procedure, situation or decision.","purpose":"Implementing medical restraints is risky and can result in damage to the patient if they are not carefully implemented. Nurses fulfil an important role in identifying risks, observing the effect of the restraints and any changes to the policy in terms of medical restraints. Recording all information on the measures is of major importance for insight into decision-making, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the measures. In the event of a transfer to the next facility, the proper preparations can be taken to safely continue the care and to limit the risks to the patient and their environment.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-freedomrestrictingmeasures-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/FreedomRestrictingMeasures-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM FreedomRestrictingMeasures-v3.1-(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"contextType":"resource","context":["Procedure"],"type":"Extension","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Extension","path":"Extension","short":"LegallyCapable","definition":"Indicator stating whether the patient is deemed capable of overseeing the consequences of a certain procedure, situation or decision.","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Extension.extension","path":"Extension.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Extension.extension:LegallyCapableIndicator","path":"Extension.extension","sliceName":"LegallyCapableIndicator","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Extension.extension:LegallyCapableIndicator.url","path":"Extension.extension.url","fixedUri":"LegallyCapableIndicator"},{"id":"Extension.extension:LegallyCapableIndicator.value[x]:valueBoolean","path":"Extension.extension.valueBoolean","sliceName":"valueBoolean","short":"LegallyCapable","definition":"Indicator stating whether the patient is deemed capable of overseeing the consequences of a certain procedure, situation or decision.","alias":["Wilsbekwaam"],"type":[{"code":"boolean"}]},{"id":"Extension.extension:LegallyCapableComment","path":"Extension.extension","sliceName":"LegallyCapableComment","max":"1"},{"id":"Extension.extension:LegallyCapableComment.url","path":"Extension.extension.url","fixedUri":"LegallyCapableComment"},{"id":"Extension.extension:LegallyCapableComment.value[x]:valueString","path":"Extension.extension.valueString","sliceName":"valueString","short":"LegallyCapableComment","definition":"Comment on the decisions which the patient is legally capable of making.","alias":["WilsbekwaamToelichting"],"type":[{"code":"string"}]},{"id":"Extension.url","path":"Extension.url","fixedUri":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-FreedomRestrictingMeasures-LegallyCapable"},{"id":"Extension.value[x]","path":"Extension.value[x]","max":"0"}]}}

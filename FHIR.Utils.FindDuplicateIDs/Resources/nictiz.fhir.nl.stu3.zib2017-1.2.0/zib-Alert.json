These are described in a separate information model. \r\nWarnings for non-allergic disorders can concern:\r\n- A disorder (condition or diagnosis which can be considered as a contraindication for the use of groups of medication or undergoing a certain type of therapy), such as pregnancy or long QT syndrome\r\n- Impaired functioning of an organ system (heart failure, impaired liver or kidney function, weakened immune system) \r\n- Risk of spreading certain microorganisms (multi-resistant bacteria, tubercle bacilli, HIV, HBV, Ebola virus)\r\n- Other risks","purpose":"Documenting and entering disorders or conditions that require attention is an important part of medical registration. It concerns the core of patient safety. In the execution of research and treatment, these patient characteristics - which are marked as a warning - constantly have to be taken into account. They provide information that is important for the patient’s condition and the options a healthcare provider has for therapy. Disorders that are registered or transferred as an Alert can also be described as a Problem. The difference is in the fact that the healthcare provider considers the problem as an Alert = warning. In many cases, transfer will be subject to strict privacy rules, as the warning will not always elicit an adequate reaction in the informed environment.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-alert-v1.0-2015EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Alert-v1.0(2015EN)","name":"HCIM Alert-v1.0(2015EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-alert-v3.0-2016EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Alert-v3.0(2016EN)","name":"HCIM Alert-v3.0(2016EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-alert-v3.2-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Alert-v3.2(2017EN)","name":"HCIM Alert-v3.2(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Flag","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Flag","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Flag","path":"Flag","short":"Alert","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-alert-v1.0-2015EN","map":"NL-CM:8.3.1","comment":"Alert"},{"identity":"hcim-alert-v3.0-2016EN","map":"NL-CM:8.3.1","comment":"Alert"},{"identity":"hcim-alert-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:8.3.1","comment":"Alert"}]},{"id":"Flag.extension","path":"Flag.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Flag.extension:ConcernReference","path":"Flag.extension","sliceName":"ConcernReference","short":"Condition","definition":"The patient’s health problem or condition that is the subject of the alert.

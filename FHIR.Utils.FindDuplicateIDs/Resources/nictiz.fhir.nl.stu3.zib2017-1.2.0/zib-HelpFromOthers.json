Their efforts enable the patient to function more or less independently. This includes not only caregivers, but also professional help such as that offered by home care organizations, nurses, aids and helpers. Current doctors and staff from the facility to which a patient is admitted do not fall under this concept.","purpose":"Information on help from others can provide a good estimate of the availability of the care required by the patient. If this care is not sufficiently available, measures can be taken to facilitate the required care. This plays a particularly important role in for example discharges from the hospital or from a nursing home.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-helpfromothers-v3.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/HelpFromOthers-v3.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM HelpFromOthers-v3.0(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"CarePlan","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CarePlan","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"CarePlan.identifier","path":"CarePlan.identifier","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:0.0.6","comment":"IdentificationNumber"}]},{"id":"CarePlan.intent","path":"CarePlan.intent","short":"plan","comment":"Although the Zib is not really a (care)plan, this resources falls almost completly inline with the Zib.

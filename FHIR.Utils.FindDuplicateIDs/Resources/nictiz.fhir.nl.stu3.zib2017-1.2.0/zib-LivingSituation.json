This is in regard to any current or future problems the patient encounters or could encounter when living with the disease and the patient’s (future) constraints. \r\nThere are many reasons to ask about the patient’s living situation. The living situation can be relevant in the patient’s wish to live in their own home independently in the event of disease and/or disability (WMO, 2011; CIZ, 2011). Furthermore, the living situation is important in evaluating the risks of falling, particularly among people living alone (CMO, guidelines for fall prevention, 2004).","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v1.2-2015EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/LivingSituation-v1.2(2015EN)","name":"HCIM LivingSituation-v1.2(2015EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/LivingSituation-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM LivingSituation-v3.1(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-3.0-2016EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/LivingSituation-v3.0(2016EN)","name":"HCIM LivingSituation-v3.0(2016EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation","path":"Observation","short":"LivingSituation","definition":"Root concept of the LivingSituation information model.

In FHIR R4 this was fixed. In this case, an extension will contain the reference of the appropriate type. This leads to slight duplication: the original Reference.display will be duplicated into the Reference.extension.valueReference.display. Systems that do not know about the extension would thus still have access to the regular Reference.display.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","kind":"complex-type","abstract":false,"contextType":"resource","context":["Reference","Media.operator"],"type":"Extension","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Extension.url","path":"Extension.url","fixedUri":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/media-operator-patient-reference"},{"id":"Extension.value[x]:valueReference","path":"Extension.valueReference","sliceName":"valueReference","type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-patient"}]}]}}

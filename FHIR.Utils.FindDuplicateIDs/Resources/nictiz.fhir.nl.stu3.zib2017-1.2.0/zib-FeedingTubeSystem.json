A feeding tube can be inserted through the nose, in the stomach or in the intestines (duodenum, jejunum). \r\n\r\nPercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a technique in which a feeding tube is placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. This thin tube (PEG tube) is used to feed a patient who is incapable of oral food intake for a prolonged period of time.","purpose":"The purpose of a feeding tube is usually to administer food and/or medication. \r\nInformation on present feeding tubes is recorded to inform other health professionals. This information is of importance in determining the care required for the patient and in safely administering medication. In a transfer situation, the information offers the option to realize continuity of care by organizing specific expertise and materials in advance, for example.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-feedingtubesystem-v3.2-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/FeedingTubeSystem-v3.2(2017EN)","name":"HCIM FeedingTubeSystem-v3.2(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"DeviceUseStatement","baseDefinition":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-MedicalDevice","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"DeviceUseStatement","path":"DeviceUseStatement","short":"FeedingTubeSystem","definition":"FeedingTube describes the presence of a feeding tube.

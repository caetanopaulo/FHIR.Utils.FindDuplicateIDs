A stoma is created e.g. as an exit opening for feces or urine in the event that they cannot leave the body naturally. In the case of a tracheostomy, the stoma is intended to facilitate breathing if that is no longer possible via the oral, nasal and throat cavity.","purpose":"Information on present stomas is recorded to inform other health professionals.
